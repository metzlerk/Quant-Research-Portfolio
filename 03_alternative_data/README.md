# Alternative Data Integration

## Overview

This module implements methods for integrating alternative data sources with traditional financial models to enhance signal generation and risk management. The module focuses on:

1. **News Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting sentiment signals from financial news
2. **Social Media Data**: Analyzing social sentiment from platforms like Twitter
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating predictive features from alternative data
4. **Signal Integration**: Combining alternative data signals with traditional price-based strategies

## Mathematical Foundations

The alternative data integration techniques are built on robust mathematical and statistical foundations:

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment scores are derived using lexicon-based approaches and natural language processing techniques. The sentiment analysis pipeline includes:

- Text preprocessing and normalization
- Sentiment scoring using VADER lexicon (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Time series aggregation and smoothing

The compound sentiment score is defined as:

$$\text{compound} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + \alpha}}$$

where $x$ is the sum of valence scores, and $\alpha$ is a normalization parameter.

### Temporal Alignment

Alternative data often has different timestamps and frequencies compared to market data. We implement temporal alignment using the following approaches:

- Forward filling for discrete events
- Exponential decay weighting for time-sensitive information
- Cross-correlation analysis for lead-lag relationships

### Feature Importance Measurement

The importance of alternative data features is measured using:

- Mutual information: $I(X;Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$
- Information coefficient: $IC = \text{corr}(predicted, actual)$
- Random Forest feature importance based on Gini impurity reduction

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes

1. **`BaseAlternativeData`**: Abstract base class for alternative data sources
2. **`NewsSentimentAnalyzer`**: Implementation for news sentiment extraction and processing
3. **`SocialMediaSentiment`**: Implementation for social media sentiment analysis
4. **`AlternativeDataIntegration`**: Main class for integrating multiple alternative data sources

### Data Flow

```
Raw Alternative Data → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Temporal Alignment → Signal Generation
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

```python
from alternative_data import AlternativeDataIntegration

# Initialize alternative data integrator
alt_data = AlternativeDataIntegration(data_dir="data/alternative")

# Integrate news sentiment with market data
enhanced_data = alt_data.news_analyzer.integrate_with_market_data(
    ticker="AAPL",
    market_data=price_data,
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2023-12-31"
)
```

### Creating Sentiment-Enhanced Trading Signals

```python
# Generate trading signals with sentiment enhancement
def generate_sentiment_signals(data, sentiment_col="compound_30d_avg"):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    
    # Use price momentum
    signals["price_momentum"] = data["Close"].pct_change(20)
    
    # Enhance with sentiment
    signals["sentiment"] = data[sentiment_col]
    
    # Generate final signal
    signals["final_signal"] = signals["price_momentum"].rank(pct=True)
    signals["final_signal"] = signals["final_signal"] * (1 + 0.5 * signals["sentiment"])
    
    return signals
```

## Utility Functions

The `alternative_utils.py` module provides various helper functions:

- `calculate_lead_lag_correlation()`: Identify temporal relationships between alternative data and market data
- `evaluate_feature_predictive_power()`: Measure the forecasting ability of alternative data features
- `backtest_signal_accuracy()`: Evaluate the accuracy of signals derived from alternative data
- `create_alternative_data_dashboard()`: Visualize alternative data alongside market data
